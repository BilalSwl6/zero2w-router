# Day 1 - 24/10/2025

Take a raspi Zero 2W and and setup things like install Install 64 Raspi OS and install netfilter-persistent, dnsmasq and setup persistent ip and also start dnsmasq for DNS forwarder. 
edit files like config.txt and cmdline.txt in boot folder. 
at the end insert a micro USB data cable in USB port in Raspi (not in PWR IN). and other end in Chromebook and it show Ethernet is connected.
create systemd service file to start auto forwarding on start. because its was not working after restart. and also set rules for NAT because it just connected but internet not working
everything is fine

## 10/31/2025 11 PM - Design Schematic and routed PCB  

# Log 2 - 25/10/2025

First time ever use easyeda, and learn how things works. its very similar but different from other graphics software like illustrator and coreldraw. design schematic. learn how to button and led are wired (specially 4-pin tectile button). 
Design PCB and route it. learn about double and multi layer PCB. route, layer and other things try for the first time and enjoy while wire things
now trying to understand about BOM, and how to assign lcsc and why lcsc. 
also trying to figure out other things about easyeda tool that I not used yet and learning how to make professional like things and standerds

here is my progress

## 11/1/2025 - design Box design and also add in assembly  

Use Onshape to make project and make the cover box for Raspi and PCB as well.
initially just design box and import design for Raspi, and assemble both in assembly. 
it have seprate space for fan and holes on side to remove heat and design of heat sink.
